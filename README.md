# Rossmann ETL and Machine Learning Project

This repository contains the ETL scripts, exploratory data analysis notebooks, and machine learning models used for the
Rossmann tasks.

## Project Setup

### 1. Create and activate virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install required Python packages (nbformat might be required)

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
pip install nbformat  
```

### 3. Run the ETL pipeline

This step loads raw CSV files, merges store metadata, state level data, and geo information, performs cleaning, and
writes outputs into `Data/processed`.

```bash
python ETL/etl_main.py
```

### 3.1 Install Jupyter Notebook (if not already installed)

```bash install jupyter
pip install notebook
```

### 3.2 Launch Jupyter Notebook (if not already launched)

```bash install jupyter
jupyter notebook
```

### 4. Run EDA notebook

Open the notebook inside the `EDA` folder and execute it to generate all statistical summaries, outlier detection, time
based analysis, geo visualizations, and interactive charts.

## Project Structure

        processed/        # generated by ETL (not tracked in git)
        raw/              # original CSVs (optional)

## Notes

- The `Data` folder is not tracked in version control unless added manually.
- The `venv` folder is excluded through `.gitignore`.
- All scripts assume local file access.
- Geo and state datasets are merged during ETL to enable advanced visualizations (map based charts, state level
  comparison, etc.).
